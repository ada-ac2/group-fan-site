                <h2>Mooncake for Mid-Autumn Festival</h2>
                <h4>Author: Jennifer </h4>
                <h4>Date: 2019-08-01</h4>
                <p> My family is so excited to celebrate one of our favorite Chinese celebrations soon. 
                    It’s called the Mid-Autumn Festival (中秋節, Zhōngqiū Jié). The celebration is around 
                    the new fall moon so under the lunar calendar this year it will be on Friday, 
                    September 13, 2019. Many countries in Asia observe this festival including Taiwan, 
                    China, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea, Japan, Philippines, 
                    and Cambodia. My husband is Taiwanese American so the way we celebrate and make our 
                    mooncakes might be different than others. </p>

                <h2>Nepoleon Cake is my favorite cake</h2>
                <h4>Author: Olga</h4>
                <h4>Date: 2018-07-20</h4>
                <p> Napoleon Cake is one of my favorite classic Russian cakes. It has a multitude of very 
                    thin cake layers that are made from puff pastry dough and are so flaky, puffy and delicate. 
                    The smooth, rich and luscious pastry cream is such a magical combination with the cake layers. 
                    I make my frosting even better with a combination of pastry cream, buttercream and lighten it 
                    up with some whipped cream, which makes it so fluffy, luxurious and velvety in texture.  It 
                    becomes so billowy and soft, almost cloud like.</p>
