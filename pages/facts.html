            In 1912, the first iteration of the cake was crafted to honor the 100th anniversary of the country's victory over Napoleon
            and his troops. Initially, the cake was much smaller: a single-serve, cream-filled pastry crafted to resemble the defeated 
            Frenchman's triangular bicorne.<br>

                <p class = "text-section">
                The name canelé comes from the French word for “fluted.” According to cookbooks, the cannele Bordelaise 
                could date back to anywhere between the 15th and 18th centuries, and most of the history books concur 
                that the pastry originated in various convents around the winemaking regions of Bordeaux in Southern France. 
                Winemakers used egg whites to clarify wine and would give the excess egg yolks to nuns to make food for poor 
                children. With the addition of a few other ingredients, the canelé was born.<br>

              <p class = "text-section">
                The Roman Empire is the true origin of this dessert. The word flan is the French equivalent of the Latin 
                word fladon, which comes from the Old High German word “flado,” meaning “flat cake.” Flan was once a savory 
                dish, usually made from fish or meat. Today, the dessert has evolved into something sweet.<br>
