      <h3>Welcome to Rose-Ringed Parakeet's Fan Page!</h3>
      <p>These birds where first bred by the people of India at least 3,000 years ago, and colour mutations of Rose-ringed parakeets were also bred. The royals prized them as pets and for their ability to speak. It was a popular status symbol in Indian culture to have a Rose-ringed parakeet. They were the first parrots brought to Europe and the Greeks were the first Europeans to breed them. Socrates is reported to have praised its beauty and ability to speak. The Romans then bred them for pets, and their beauty in their aviaries.</p>
